                    <p>My name is Ash, I'm 16. Outside of school, I don't do much. I mainly stay inside and play video games or do other activities that don't involve leaving the house. I know how to code in Java, and I used to know Python a little bit, but I've probably forgotten.</p>

                <h2>My Work</h2>
                <p><a class="gui app" href="https://github.com/AshdenLoganTriviaApp/trivia-Game">App 1</a> I worked with Logan to make this app. It is a trivia game where the user is asked questions and has to give answers. I used JOptionPane to add buttons or input fields for the user to answer questions. I plan to add more questions and variation in answers, or make the UI look nicer.</p>
                <p><a class="interactive app" href="https://github.com/Ashdenm/culminating-assignment">App 2</a> I made this app on my own. It's a (currently) simplified version of a DnD character creator, where it asks the user for a race, class, stats, etc., and calculates various abilities. I plan to eventually make it a full character creator with more options for classes, and to fully flesh out each system. </p>
